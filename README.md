# htmly

A simple app aimed at introducing HTML to 10 years olds at a German school.
Uses local storage to store changes as the student progresses.

## Development

Start a REPL (in a terminal: `lein repl`, or from Emacs: open a
clj/cljs file in the project, then do `M-x cider-jack-in`. Make sure
CIDER is up to date).

In the REPL do

```clojure
(run)
(browser-repl)
```

The call to `(run)` does two things, it starts the webserver at port
10555, and also the Figwheel server which takes care of live reloading
ClojureScript code and CSS. Give them some time to start.

Running `(browser-repl)` starts the Weasel REPL server, and drops you
into a ClojureScript REPL. Evaluating expressions here will only work
once you've loaded the page, so the browser can connect to Weasel.

When you see the line `Successfully compiled "resources/public/app.js"
in 21.36 seconds.`, you're ready to go. Browse to
`http://localhost:10555` and enjoy.
